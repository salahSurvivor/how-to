To get the SENDGRID_API_KEY to use in your SendGrid application, you need to create an API key in the SendGrid dashboard. Here are the steps to create an API key:

- Log in to your SendGrid account and go to Settings > API Keys.
- Click on the "Create API Key" button.
- Give your API key a name and select the permissions you want to grant to it.
- Click on the "Create & View" button.

Your new API key will be displayed on the next page. Copy the API key value to use in your Node.js application.
Note that you should treat your SendGrid API key as a secret and never share it publicly or commit it to version control. You can use environment variables, such as process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY, to store your API key securely in your application.
